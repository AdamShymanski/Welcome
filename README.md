As a skilled and experienced professional, I offer comprehensive and hassle-free services in web and mobile app development. My expertise spans across diverse areas, from marketing to veterinary services, and from trading cards to fashion brands. I have a proven track record of creating successful digital products that meet the needs of my clients and exceed their expectations.

My most notable projects include the VARP marketing platform, which was a web application that allowed users to earn money by filling out surveys for external companies conducting market audits. I designed the platform's UI/UX and handled payment and withdrawal management, working alongside a team of professionals and external clients. 

Another major project was the TCM Trading Card Marketplace, a large mobile application available on Android and iOS, which facilitated the trading of collectible cards in Europe and America. I developed this app using cutting-edge mobile app development technology, and it featured a great UI/UX that I designed, a comprehensive user support system, multiple payment methods, a search engine, and much more.

I have also collaborated with public educational institutions, such as the 1st Miko≈Çaj Kopernik High School in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where I created a web tool for guest sign-ups for various events, including open days. The main focus of this project was on creating a user-friendly platform, while also ensuring that organizers could access the necessary data easily and quickly. The minimalist design and UI/UX aspects presented a unique challenge, which I successfully overcame, resulting in a time-saving solution for the school's staff.

I have also worked with the York Veterinary Clinic, creating a professional website that showcased the clinic's services, with a strong emphasis on SEO. The design aimed to convey a sense of trustworthiness, as clients' pets' health is at stake. The result was a significant increase in the number of patients and website traffic.

Overall, I offer personalized services tailored to meet the unique needs of each project, with a keen eye for customer satisfaction and a commitment to exceeding expectations. My extensive industry connections mean that I can quickly and easily source any additional graphic or digital product requirements that a project may need. With my experience as an entrepreneur, I understand the position of my clients, and I approach each project with the utmost professionalism and care.
